Decode data from RoseyCubesat-1!

# How to decode:

There's a file in the repo called "original.txt." This can be used for testing. 

You need to have some frames from RoseyCubesat-1 to decode. SatNogs DB has this. The script reads satnogs frames from a file (always "original.txt"), and then dumps them to an image called "output.png." This is very much a work-in-progress, and things may change.
